# pandas-challenge analysis 

Overall the schools with a "Higher spending range(Per Student)" have a substantially higher "% Overall Passing" at 90% at the highest spending and 81% at the second highest spending. The lowest and second lowest spending range per student resulted in a "% Overall Passing" of 62% and 53%.

The larger schools have a much lower "% Overall Passing" at 58% as opposed to small and medium which have a "% Overall Passing" of 89 and 90 respectfully.

The above statistic also is represented in the total number of students in the top schools. In the top 5 schools there is a significant drop in total number of students as opposed to the bottom 5 schools which have much more students per school.

Finally the most obvious takeaway from my analysis of these schools is the substantial gap between the "% Overall Passing" from Charter schools to District schools. Charter schools have an "% Overall Passing" of 90% which is much greater than that of the District schools which is at an appalling 53%.
